It has been noted that during the last decade the use of natural resources has been increased due to the increasing population. Through the influence of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), there had been made many attempts to improve the environment by weakening the negative impacts that have made the environment worst. The fascination towards technologies has led to a negative impact on the environment and it is getting deeper and deeper.</p>

In the last few months, there has been a lot of buzz around it, particularly among college graduates.
